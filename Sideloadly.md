Fix for "Your session has expired. Please log in." and potentially other login issues:
1. Close iTunes if it's opened. Kill it from the Task Manager.
    
2. Open **Start** > **Run** > type in **%ProgramData%** and hit enter.
    
3. Next, navigate inside **Apple Computer** > **iTunes**. The complete path will be: **C:\ProgramData\Apple Computer\iTunes**
    
4. Now you can safely rename the "**adi**" folder to "**adi.bak**" or just delete it.
    
5. Open Sideloadly and then try sideloading an IPA and you will be asked for your Apple ID password again.
