`streamlink --player flatpak --player-args 'run org.videolan.VLC {filename}' URL STREAM`

**In the Twitch GUI, you can add these parameters in the player settings menu.** When you're not using a player profile, set the player path to `flatpak` or `/usr/bin/flatpak` and the custom args to `run org.videolan.VLC` which will appear once you've set a custom player path.
