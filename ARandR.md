After monitor & panel configuration is finished, use ARandR to save settings to a script. Need to add refresh rate manually, example: `--rate 240`

ARandR is useful for toggling monitors on/off.

Rarely but occasionally I experience a bug with XFCE that centers panels based on total multi-monitor display dimensions; offsetting panel incorrectly.

Running ARandR scripts fixes this bug.
  

Apply in display settings to save as default configuration.*
