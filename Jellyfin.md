### Misc:
Restoring backup: change ownership after deployment:  
``sudo chown -R jellyfin: /var/lib/jellyfin /etc/jellyfin``  

Fix Jellyfin XML error on startup: https://forum.jellyfin.org/t-solved-xml-error-on-startup  

`mkdir /tmp/jellyfin/` before launching & use Flatseal to allow access to `/tmp/jellyfin/` if insufficient space.  
  
Always shutdown before updating Jellyfin.
